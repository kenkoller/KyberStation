## [Unreleased]

Tracking work on the v1.0 path.

### Modulation Routing v1.1 Core — overnight wave (2026-04-27)

Eight PRs landed overnight on top of v0.14.0, completing the v1.1 Core scope from `docs/MODULATION_ROUTING_ROADMAP.md`. Three parallel-agent phases (Phase 1: 4 worktree agents, Phase 2a: 3 worktree agents, Phase 2b: Wave 5 salvaged after agent stalled). All CI-green, all merged. **No tag cut yet — pending hardware validation. Candidate `v0.15.0`.**

#### Added

- **All 11 modulators surface as plates** (was 5 in v1.0). PR #57 unblocks `twist` / `battery` / `lockup` / `preon` / `ignition` / `retraction` with bespoke CSS-keyframe live-viz glyphs. Plate grid `lg:grid-cols-4 xl:grid-cols-6` for 11-plate readability.
- **Reciprocal hover highlight** — hovering any parameter row in ParameterBank now lights up every modulator plate that drives it (PR #61). New `uiStore.hoveredParameterPath` field. Multi-driver case lights multiple plates simultaneously. Replaces the 2026-04-20 1:1 placeholder mapping.
- **Per-binding expression editing** — magenta `fx` button on every expression-bound row in `BindingList` opens `ExpressionEditor` preloaded with the existing source for in-place iteration (PR #63). Bare-source rows leave the slot empty so column alignment stays consistent.
- **True drag-to-route** — HTML5 drag-and-drop layered on click-to-route as the primary mouse/trackpad gesture, Vital / Bitwig style (PR #64). Plates are draggable; slider rows are drop targets with identity-color visual cue. New `useClickToRoute.dragBind(modulatorId, targetPath)` action. MIME type `application/x-kyberstation-modulator` exported as a constant. Click-to-route preserved as keyboard / a11y fallback.
- **AST-level template injection in codegen** (PR #60) — `composeBindings(ast, mappable)` walks the style AST and grafts each mapped binding's `astPatch` into the slot identified by `targetPath`. v1.1 Core ships the **shimmer-Mix slot pattern** (`Mix<Int<N>, X, Y>`) used by every base-style. `generateStyleCode` rewired: mapBindings → applyModulationSnapshot baseline → buildAST → composeBindings → emitCode + v1.1 comment block distinguishing live / snapshotted / deferred / skipped bindings. Snapshot path retained for unmappable bindings as the always-flashable fallback.
- **5 new starter recipes** (PR #58): `heartbeat-pulse` (`abs(sin(time*0.002))`), `battery-saver` (`clamp(1-battery, 0, 0.5)`), `idle-hue-drift`, `sound-driven-hue`, `twist-driven-saturation`. Recipe library 6 → 11. `V1_0_RECIPES` 8; `V1_1_EXPRESSION_RECIPES` 3.
- **7 new user-guide pages** (PR #59) — `recipes.md` / `combinators.md` / `modulators.md` / `expressions.md` / `canon-patterns.md` / `troubleshooting.md` / `sharing.md`. ~5,400 new words, voice-matched to the existing quick-start. Honest-scope-tagged (`v1.0` / `v1.1+` / `v1.2+`).
- `MODULATOR_DRAG_MIME_TYPE` constant exported from `useClickToRoute` (PR #64).
- `MODULATOR_DRAG_MIME_TYPE` constant + `dragBind` action in `useClickToRoute` (PR #64).
- `applyModulationSnapshot.ts` — new `onlyBindingIds` filter + `CommentBlockExtras` shape with `mappedBindings` / `deferredFromMapping` for the v1.1 comment block (PR #60).

#### Changed

- **`generateStyleCode` flow rewired** to a 6-step pipeline (PR #60): mapBindings → applyModulationSnapshot baseline → buildAST → composeBindings (overwrites mappable slots with live drivers) → emitCode → v1.1 comment block. Backward-compatible — configs without modulation payload short-circuit to byte-identical v0.14.0 output.
- **BindingList row grid** picked up a 28-px fx-slot column (PR #63) — bare-source rows render an empty placeholder so the columns stay aligned across mixed lists.
- **Modulator plate grid** bumped from `lg:grid-cols-5` to `lg:grid-cols-4 xl:grid-cols-6` to fit 11 plates readably (PR #57).

#### Tests

- **codegen**: 1,842 → 1,859 (+17 new in `composeBindings.test.ts`, PR #62).
- **web**: 1,025 → 1,041+ (+9 dragBind in `useClickToRoute.test.ts` from PR #64; +7 in `bindingListEditExpression.test.tsx` from PR #63; reciprocal-hover regression coverage from PR #61).
- **presets**: 29 → 47 (+18 in `recipes.test.ts` from PR #58).

#### Backfill

- **PR #62 — composeBindings test backfill.** PR #60 (Wave 6) shipped the AST composer without test coverage due to a worktree-environment file-revert issue mid-agent. PR #62 adds 17 tests across 9 groups (pure-function invariants, single binding, breathing heuristic, multi-binding, deferred fall-through, purity / idempotency / structural sharing, result shape, `generateStyleCode` integration, snapshot/live boundary).

#### Salvage

- **PR #64 — Wave 5 (drag-to-route) post-stall recovery.** Background agent stalled post-implementation but pre-commit. Parent session re-ran typecheck + tests against the worktree (clean, 1041 web tests passing), committed the agent's exact code, pushed, and opened the PR. Code is the agent's; commit message + PR shape are the parent session's.

#### Open / pending

- Wave 7 — Kyber Glyph v2 modulation round-trip (encoder body)
- Wave 8 — Button routing sub-tab + aux/gesture-as-modulator plates (L scope, separate session)
- Wave 10 — Hardware validation + V2.2 modulation flash + cut `v0.15.0` tag (hardware-gated)
- Wave 6 follow-on — composer slot expansion to per-channel RGB + timing scalars (v1.2 candidates per PR #60 body)
- Manual visual verification of all 8 PRs in the live editor

### Blade render rewrite — capsule rasterizer + additive composite (2026-04-27)

Major rework of the blade preview pipeline, landed on `feat/blade-layers-debug`. Collapses the prior body + separate tip cap + parallel offscreen mirror into a single per-pixel capsule rasterizer that's the source of truth for blade geometry. Pipeline goes from 14 passes → 13, ~140 lines of body/cap matching code removed.

- **Capsule rasterizer** — `rasterizeCapsuleToOffscreen` walks the capsule's bounding box per-pixel, samples LED color via axial position with linear interpolation between adjacent LEDs, applies a feathered Gaussian-α radial profile, and lerps toward a luma-driven white-shifted core. Capsule is fixed at the full configured blade length — retraction is rendered via per-LED brightness (engine-driven), not geometry truncation, so the tube doesn't physically shrink during retract. Replaces 4 parallel render paths (offscreen body + offscreen cap + visible body + visible cap) with one.
- **Sharp + soft offscreen split** — sharp offscreen feeds the visible body composite; soft offscreen (sharp + diffusion blur) feeds the bloom mips. Decouples "crisp body silhouette" from "diffuse halo source" so cranking diffusion doesn't shorten or soften the visible blade.
- **Pass 12 additive blend** — body capsule now ADDS to the bloom underneath via `lighter` blend instead of occluding it via normal alpha. Eliminates the visible "body sitting on top of halo" seam that the prior normal-blend produced at the body's α-decay zone. Physically correct compositing for emissive surfaces — light adds, doesn't replace.
- **Feathered Gaussian α profile** — rasterizer's α curve is now a smooth bell shape (1.0 at center, 0 at rim) with no plateau. Combined with the additive composite, the body and surrounding bloom are continuous expressions of the same emission. No detectable boundary between body silhouette and halo.
- **Tip axial extension** — geometric capsule rim sits 0.15 × radius past the LED endpoint so the feathered α can decay to 0 at the rim while visible-bright pixels reach EXACTLY the configured blade length (verified to the pixel for a 40" blade — body terminates at the 40" grid mark, bloom continues past as natural surrounding halo).
- **Body height rebalanced** (`BLADE_CORE_H` 26 → 32) — paired with the feathered α curve to give a clearly-defined bright tube proportional to the BLADE itself (~1" real neopixel diameter), not the hilt graphic. Hilt is treated as a visual placeholder; blade width stays consistent regardless of hilt sizing.
- **Hilt-tuck + clipped body** — capsule extends `coreH` left of the hilt edge so its rounded LEFT cap sits behind the hilt (invisible to the user, but bloom mips still see it and produce halo into the hilt area). Visible body composite is clipped to `x ≥ bladeStartPx` so the body itself doesn't paint over the hilt's metallic surface. Hilt drawn before bloom so additive bloom mips spill onto the metal naturally — preserves the "lit blade illuminating the metal" look.
- **Per-LED axial linear interpolation** — eliminates hard vertical seams between bright and dim adjacent LEDs (prior hard quantization showed ~17 luma steps every 6 px at a Stripes-style transition; max per-pixel delta now ~3 luma). Implements axial polycarbonate diffusion: light from each LED bleeds into its neighbors along the tube length.
- **+25% white-core exposure boost** — `ledCoreWhiteAmount` multiplied 1.25× (clamped to 1.0). White plateau now reaches pure white (luma 250+) instead of stopping at the per-color asymptote (0.82–0.95). Iconic blown-out tube look for any LED color, not just white blades.
- **Drops `tests/blade/endpointSeeds.test.ts`** — sentinel for the v0.14.0 Phase 1 endpoint-seed widening (`glowCapRadius`, `emGlowR`), constants the capsule unified out of existence.

Performance: 120 FPS at 1600×1000 viewport / DPR 2. Per-pixel rasterization adds modest CPU cost but stays well within budget.

Status: shipped on `feat/blade-layers-debug`, NOT yet merged to main. Branch is in a clean checkpoint state; further tweaks to white-shift/bloom layering deferred.

### Saber Wizard — hardware step (2026-04-22)

Added a new first step to the Saber Wizard so newcomers tell the app about the saber they actually own (blade length + board) before picking aesthetic. The 3-step archetype/colour/vibe flow shifts to steps 2/3/4 and is otherwise unchanged.

- **Blade length picker** — 6 tiles (20"/24"/28"/32"/36"/40"). LED counts mirror `BLADE_LENGTH_PRESETS` in the engine package; selection writes `BladeConfig.ledCount` so every per-LED surface in the editor (BladeCanvas + PixelStripPanel + RGBGraphPanel + state-grid takeover) renders the chosen length 1:1.
- **Board picker** — 5 tiles (Proffie V3 / V2 / CFX / GH V4 / GH V3) with **3-tier compatibility chips** built on the existing `<StatusSignal>` primitive (paired colored glyph + label, colorblind-safe):
  - **VERIFIED** (green ✓) — Proffie V3, the only board hardware-validated end-to-end (per the 2026-04-20 Phase A/B/C entry above).
  - **UNTESTED** (amber ▲) — Proffie V2. Code path identical to V3, hardware testing pending. Community hardware reports welcome.
  - **REFERENCE** (red ✕) — CFX / GH V4 / GH V3. Different firmware ecosystems entirely; the editor + visualizer work but the generated config.h won't run on these boards.
  - A mini legend strip next to the "Board" heading shows what each color means.
  - Selection writes `boardType` to the active `SaberProfile` (or auto-creates a "My Saber" profile if none exists).
- **"Skip for now"** advances to the archetype step without writing anything to the blade config or profile — for users who want to dive straight into design and configure hardware later via the Profile + Code panels.
- **Initial focus** lands on the currently-selected length tile (matches selection rather than always-first), so keyboard users start where the visual selection is.

10 new contract tests in `apps/web/tests/saberWizardOptions.test.ts` guard the LED-count ↔ `inferBladeInches` mapping, the V3-only-verified tier assignment (will fail loudly when V2 gets hardware-validated, prompting a tier bump), and the storeValue strings that `CodeOutput.tsx` maps back to `proffieboard_v{2,3}`. 637 web tests pass.

### WebUSB flash — hardware validation (2026-04-20)

**Phases A + B + C all green on Proffieboard V3.9 (89sabers) + macOS 15 + Brave.** Connect → dry-run → real flash → post-write verify → recovery re-flash — full clean pass. Blade ignites blue on the first power press after replug; USB serial enumerates as `/dev/tty.usbmodem*`; audio DAC active (ProffieOS voice pack announces "SD card not found" / "font not found").

**Three real DFU protocol bugs fixed** that 576 passing mock tests had missed. Real STM32 DfuSe bootloader correctly returned STALL where the mock was too permissive:

- `DfuSeFlasher.verifyFlash`: `setAddressPointer` leaves the device in `dfuDNLOAD_IDLE`, but UPLOAD requires `dfuIDLE`. Added `abort()` between the two.
- `DfuSeFlasher.flash` (manifest step): after UPLOAD verify the device sits in `dfuUPLOAD_IDLE`, but the manifest's zero-length DNLOAD requires `dfuIDLE`. Added `abort()` before the manifest download.
- `DfuSeFlasher.waitForManifestComplete`: STM32 resets the USB bus as part of manifest (`bitManifestationTolerant=0`); the resulting `controlTransferIn` failure surfaces as a raw `DOMException`, not our `DfuError`. The old catch only swallowed `DfuError`, so successful flashes showed a red error banner. Now any error during the post-manifest poll is treated as success.

**Plus two supporting fixes uncovered while building firmware to validate against:**

- `firmware-configs/v3-standard.h`: legacy `InOutTrL<TrWipe<300>, TrWipeIn<500>, Blue>` no longer compiles against current ProffieOS master — bare `Blue` returns `RGBA_nod` which doesn't convert to `OverDriveColor`. Replaced with the modern `StyleNormalPtr<Blue, WHITE, 300, 500>` factory (same visual result).
- `.github/workflows/firmware-build.yml`: Linux runners are case-sensitive, so checking out ProffieOS into `proffieos/` broke the `arduino-cli compile <sketch-dir>` contract (ProffieOS ships `ProffieOS.ino`). Renamed the checkout path to `ProffieOS/`.

**Validated hardware scope: Proffieboard V3.9 on macOS + Chromium.** Brave is Chromium-based, and Chrome/Edge/Arc share Chromium's WebUSB implementation so they should behave identically. Windows, Linux, Proffieboard V2, and V3+OLED are untested; community hardware reports welcome via the [hardware_report](https://github.com/kenkoller/KyberStation/issues/new?template=hardware_report.md) issue template.

**Followups:**

- ~~Tighten `MockUsbDevice` to enforce the three DFU state-machine rules~~ — done (same session). `strictState` + `resetAfterManifest` options added; three regression tests added (one per bug), each verified to fail if the corresponding fix is reverted. 579 tests pass.
- Cross-OS sweep: Windows + Linux hardware smoke-tests before promoting the feature to "validated on all supported configurations".
- Cross-board sweep: Proffieboard V2.2 and V3+OLED hardware smoke-tests.

Full details in [`docs/HARDWARE_VALIDATION_TODO.md`](docs/HARDWARE_VALIDATION_TODO.md) § Phase C.


- **v0.11.1 — Design Review Polish Pass** (shipped): alert-color
  discipline, skeleton + error-state coverage, color-glyph pairing for
  accessibility, CHANGELOG + README assets, housekeeping
- **v0.11.2 — Color Naming Math** (shipped): three-tier algorithmic
  naming (landmark + modifier + coordinate-mood) expanding ~120
  curated names into 1,500+ HSL coverage
- **v0.11.3 — Modular Hilt Library** (shipped): 33 reusable line-art
  SVG parts composed into 8 canonical hilt assemblies (Graflex, MPP,
  Negotiator, Count, Shoto Sage, Vented Crossguard, Staff, Fulcrum),
  authored across 3 parallel artist-agents on top of a strict-typed
  composer + `HiltRenderer` with horizontal / vertical orientation. 8
  new SVG hilt options added to the editor's `Hilt` picker (marked
  with ✦)
- **v0.12.0 — Kyber Crystal Three.js renderer** (shipped): full 3D
  crystal component with PBR materials, 5 procedural Forms, bleed +
  heal + first-discovery animations, scannable QR embedded, card
  snapshot pipeline
- **v0.15.0 — Preset Cartography** (planned): multi-agent preset
  expansion across deep-cut lanes (Prequel/OT/Sequel, Legends/KOTOR,
  Clone Wars, Mando/Ahsoka, cross-franchise)
- **v0.16.0 — Multi-Blade Workbench** (planned): channel-strip UI for
  editing dual-blade / saberstaff / crossguard sabers (glyph format
  already supports multi-blade from v1)

*(v0.13.0 — Launch Readiness — shipped via PR #31; v0.14.0 slot open for
reassignment after deprecating the former "Kyber Forge" ultra-wide
layout concept, which is redundant now that OV11's drag-to-resize
handles cover the ultra-wide use case.)*

### Branch protection — server-side active

After the KyberStation owner upgraded to GitHub Pro (2026-04-17
afternoon), `pnpm run branch-protection:setup` applied the
`main-protection` ruleset (id `15217927`) on `refs/heads/main`:

- `non_fast_forward` blocks force-push to main
- `deletion` blocks main-branch deletion
- `pull_request` (0 approvals required) blocks direct pushes — all
  changes must go through a PR
- `required_status_checks: build-and-test` requires CI green before
  merge

Client-side `.githooks/pre-push` remains active as defense-in-depth.

### Deferred items (documented, awaiting dedicated pickup)

- Hardware validation of WebUSB flash against real Proffieboard V2.2
  and V3.9 — see `docs/HARDWARE_VALIDATION_TODO.md`
- Real ESLint enforcement across packages (stub lint scripts currently)
- `CANONICAL_DEFAULT_CONFIG` drift-sentinel test pattern
- Shared `<HiltMesh>` extraction between `BladeCanvas3D.tsx` and
  `CrystalRevealScene.tsx`
- Crystal Vault panel (scanned-crystal collection)
- Re-attunement UI for visual-version upgrades
- Favicon replacement from crystal snapshot pipeline
- `SHARE_PACK.md` §4 size-estimate table refresh (current doc understates
  max glyph size; real measurements from PR #20 hit ~490 chars at max)

See `~/.claude/plans/declarative-strolling-dragonfly.md` for the
orchestration plan that scopes the current sprints, and
`docs/SESSION_2026-04-17.md` Part 2 for the full session summary.

### Modulation polish + a11y clean (2026-04-23 late — untagged; candidate v0.14.1 or v0.15.0 once hardware-validated)

Two PRs shipped on top of v0.14.0 (PR #41 + PR #42). Items ordered by PR.

**PR #41 — modulation follow-up (merge commit `bd9bb7b`):**

- **Generated code now reflects modulation.** `generateStyleCode` threads
  a new `applyModulationSnapshot` helper that walks
  `config.modulation.bindings`, snapshots each to its current value via
  `computeSnapshotValue`, bakes the results into the config at each
  binding's target path (shallow-clone-on-write, no mutation), and
  prepends a BETA-labeled comment block listing every applied + skipped
  binding. Opt out via `{ comments: false }` on the preset-array code
  path to avoid one-comment-per-preset clutter in the full config.h.
  Expression bindings currently snapshot; v1.1 Core adds AST-level
  template injection for `Scale<SwingSpeed<>, ...>` + friends.
- **Hover wire-highlighting + bound-param stripe.** Three priority-
  stacked visual states on every slider label in ParameterBank:
  ARMED (click-to-wire) > HOVERED (this plate drives this param) >
  BOUND (some binding targets this param — persistent left-edge
  identity-color stripe). Identity colors propagate via
  `BUILT_IN_MODULATORS` descriptors.
- **Inline BoardPicker chip in StatusBar** between Profile and Conn.
  `BOARD · PROFFIE V3.9 · FULL`; click opens the modal picker. Reactive
  across capability-sensitive UI.
- **ExpressionEditor — v1.1 Core math-formula UI.** `fx` button on every
  SliderControl opens a 380-px popover with auto-focused textarea,
  live peggy parse status (✓ Valid / ✕ with error location + message),
  5 starter-idiom chips (Breathing / Heartbeat / Battery dim / Swing
  doubled / Loud OR fast), ⌘+Enter shortcut, Escape/outside-click
  dismiss. Apply creates a binding with `source: null`, `expression: {
  source, ast }`, `combinator: 'replace'`, `amount: 1.0`. BindingList
  distinguishes expression bindings from bare-source with an `fx`
  label in status-magenta + full-source hover tooltip.
- **Color-contrast fix across 9 canvas themes + the root default.**
  `--text-muted` bumped +40 each channel (106 110 120 → 146 150 160
  for Deep Space, equivalent deltas for the other 8 themes). Fixes
  82 axe-core color-contrast violations concentrated on muted-text
  surfaces in the modulation UI.

**PR #42 — a11y clean + first expression recipe (merge commit `c0a92c4`):**

- **Zero axe-core WCAG 2 AA violations** at desktop (1600×1000, 30
  passes) AND mobile (375×812) viewports on `/editor`. Closes the P29
  launch blocker carried from v0.13.0 readiness.
  - MobileTabBar: dropped `role="tablist"` / `role="tab"` —
    semantically this is route navigation, not a tab interface;
    `aria-current="page"` handles the active state.
  - AppShell mobile tablist: scoped `role="tablist"` to an inner
    wrapper so the collapse toggle + dot indicators become siblings of
    the tablist, not children (fixes `aria-required-children`).
  - AppShell tab `aria-controls`: replaced per-tab panel IDs with a
    single stable `id="mobile-panel"`; dropped when `showPanel` is
    false and paired with `aria-expanded`.
  - MiniGalleryPicker: `role="listbox"` → `role="group"` (children use
    `role="button"`, not `role="option"`).
  - Cleared the final 5 contrast issues: DesignPanel BETA chip
    `opacity-70`, ColorPanel preset subtitle `text-accent/70`,
    PerformanceBar page tabs + SaberProfileManager source badge
    `rgb(var(--text-muted) / 0.65)`.
- **Breathing Blade — first expression-based starter recipe.**
  `sin(time * 0.001) * 0.5 + 0.5 → shimmer · replace · 100%`. AST
  hand-built inline (can't import `parseExpression` across the
  `.npmrc` hoisted boundary per CLAUDE.md decision #1). Test split:
  `V1_0_RECIPES` (5) vs `V1_1_EXPRESSION_RECIPES` (1). Presets test
  count 29 → 40. The ProffieOS emitter's existing
  `matchSinBreathingEnvelope` heuristic recognizes this exact shape
  so the flashed blade will breathe live on hardware via
  `Sin<Int<period>>`.

**Tests delta since v0.14.0:** codegen +15, presets +11, web unchanged
(new UI work covered by visual QA + axe audit, which itself ran clean
on both viewports).

**PR #43 — docs catch-up (merge commit `b98af51`):** CLAUDE.md +
CHANGELOG updates for PR #41 + PR #42. No code touched.

**PR #44 — quick-start illustrations (merge commit `bfcdbf6`):** Three
hand-authored animated SVGs replace the `[gif-placeholder]` markers in
`docs/user-guide/modulation/your-first-wire.md`:

- `first-wire-step-1.svg` (7.0 KB) — five-plate bar with per-plate
  live viz (swing needle, angle tilt, sound VU, time sweep, clash
  flash).
- `first-wire-step-2.svg` (3.4 KB) — SWING plate armed, siblings
  dimmed, "◎ swing armed" banner below.
- `first-wire-step-3.svg` (7.1 KB) — two-column frame with an
  animated dashed wire connecting plate → shimmer slider, plus the
  binding row "SWING → Shimmer · add · 60%".

~17.5 KB combined. Native SVG animation — no JS. Each has `<title>` +
`<desc>` for screen readers. Matches editor color tokens exactly. An
inline HTML comment at the bottom of the markdown documents the
replacement pass for future screen-recorded GIFs.

## [0.14.0] — 2026-04-23

### Added — Modulation Routing v1.0 Preview (BETA)

First release of the headline **Modulation Routing** feature. Turns KyberStation from a static blade picker into a "blade instrument" — users wire live signals (swing / sound / angle / time / clash) to any numeric blade parameter with a combinator + amount; bindings drive the blade render in real time at 60 FPS.

Merged via [PR #35](https://github.com/kenkoller/KyberStation/pull/35). Marked BETA in the new `ROUTING` pill; full v1.1 Core (math formula UI + remaining 6 modulators + drag-to-route + Kyber Glyph v2 sharing + V2.2 flash + button routing) lands ~3 weeks post-launch per [`docs/MODULATION_ROUTING_ROADMAP.md`](docs/MODULATION_ROUTING_ROADMAP.md).

**UI additions:**

- New `ROUTING` pill in the DesignPanel (hidden on non-Proffie boards via the Board Capability System).
- `ModulatorPlateBar` — 5 plates (`swing` / `sound` / `angle` / `time` / `clash`) with live CSS-driven identity-color viz (`--mod-swing` through `--mod-retraction`). Click to arm, Escape to disarm.
- `AddBindingForm` — dropdown source/target/combinator picker + amount scrub. Fast form-based binding creation alternative to click-to-route.
- `RecipePicker` — 5 one-click starter recipes: **Reactive Shimmer** (swing → shimmer), **Sound-Reactive Music Saber** (sound → baseColor.b), **Angle-Reactive Tip** (angle → emitterFlare), **Clash-Flash White** (3-binding clash → baseColor.{r,g,b}), **Twist-Drives-Hue** (twist → colorHueShiftSpeed).
- `BindingList` — rows with source → target arrow, combinator dropdown, amount scrub (0–100%), bypass toggle (▶/⏸), remove button. Empty state nudges toward the plate workflow.
- Click-to-route wiring in every `ParameterBank.SliderControl` — armed plate tints all slider labels in the modulator's identity color; clicking wires `source → targetPath` as a new binding with the v1.0 defaults (add combinator, 60% amount).
- Inline `BoardPicker` chip in `StatusBar` between Profile and Conn — `BOARD · PROFFIE V3.9 · FULL`; click opens modal picker with all 6 boards + color-coded status chips.
- `BoardPicker` modal + inline variants ([`apps/web/components/shared/BoardPicker.tsx`](apps/web/components/shared/BoardPicker.tsx)) — 6 boards (Proffieboard V3.9 full, V2.2 partial, Golden Harvest V3 mirrors V3.9, CFX / Xenopixel / Verso preview-only), status chips, hardware-validated ✓ badge on V3.9.

**Engine additions** (`packages/engine/src/modulation/`):

- `registry.ts` — 11 built-in `ModulatorDescriptor`s with identity colors, ranges, units, one-pole smoothing coefficients, clash latch metadata.
- `sampler.ts` — per-frame value extraction + one-pole smoothing + clash latching with decay. Returns a frozen `SamplerState` consumed by `applyBindings`.
- `applyBindings.ts` — pure binding composer. Walks bindings in authoring order, composes with the 5 combinators (`replace` / `add` / `multiply` / `min` / `max`), sanitizes NaN / ±∞ / out-of-range values against per-parameter clamp data.
- `parser.ts` + `grammar.peggy` — peggy 4.2 expression parser for the math-formula mini-language (arithmetic + 10 built-in functions `min` / `max` / `clamp` / `lerp` / `sin` / `cos` / `abs` / `floor` / `ceil` / `round`). Runtime-compiled; module-level parser singleton. Drift-sentinel fixtures: 63 accept / 61 reject.
- `evaluator.ts` — tree-walk interpreter over `ExpressionNode`. Missing modulator IDs fall through to `0`; NaN / Infinity propagate (sanitizer upstream of the engine cleans up).
- `BladeEngine.update()` now samples modulators + applies bindings before style rendering; persistent `_samplerState` for smoothing continuity; `setParameterClampRanges(map)` API for the web layer to push per-parameter range constraints; `getSamplerState()` accessor for future UI viz.
- `packages/engine/src/index.ts` top-level barrel re-exports the full modulation subsystem so consumers (codegen, web, presets) can import from `@kyberstation/engine` directly.

**Codegen additions** (`packages/codegen/src/proffieOSEmitter/`):

- `mapBindings.ts` — Option B+ export semantics. Maps each binding to equivalent ProffieOS templates where possible (`Scale<SwingSpeed<>>`, `Sin<Int<>>`, `SoundLevel<>`, etc.); returns a `snapshotValue` fallback for unmappable bindings (expressions in v1.0, modulator chains, enum-targeted bindings). `MAP_BINDINGS_REASONS` constant exports the exact user-facing reason strings for the Flash dialog's per-binding review. Mirrors engine types inline with a drift-sentinel test per the CLAUDE.md decision #1 pattern.

**Web library additions** (`apps/web/lib/`):

- `parameterGroups.ts` — 77 modulatable `BladeConfig` fields enumerated with `path` / `displayName` / `group` / `range` / `default` / `unit` / `isModulatable`. 5 groups (color / motion / timing / style / other). Drives drop-target validation, parameter clamping, and the AddBindingForm's target picker.
- `boardProfiles.ts` — 6 board profiles: **Proffieboard V3.9** (full, hardware-validated) / **V2.2** (partial; modulation disabled in v1.0 until V2 hardware validation) / **Golden Harvest V3** (mirrors V3.9) / **CFX** / **Xenopixel** / **Verso** (last three: preview-only, modulation hidden). Each profile declares hardware (flash size, max LEDs, buttons, OLED), firmware, feature support (styles / effects / ignitions / retractions / SmoothSwing / prop files), modulation capability flags (supported modulators + functions + max bindings + soft/hard warnings + chains / step-seq / envelope-follower), and template emission ceilings. Helpers: `getBoardProfile` / `canBoardModulate` / `isParameterModulatableOnBoard` / `DEFAULT_BOARD_ID`.
- `propFileProfiles.ts` — 4 prop file profiles (Fett263 most-flexible, SA22C, BC Button Controls, Default Fett) with button event + gesture event vocabularies.

**Store additions:**

- `bladeStore.config.modulation?: ModulationPayload` (optional, backward-compatible) + `addBinding` / `removeBinding` / `updateBinding` / `toggleBindingBypass` / `clearAllBindings` actions.
- `uiStore.armedModulatorId: string | null` + `setArmedModulatorId` — click-to-route arm state, separate from `selectedLayerId` (which drives the layer-config panel).

**Hooks:**

- `useBoardProfile()` — reactive board selection backed by `localStorage.kyberstation.board.selected` with cross-tab sync via a `board-profile-changed` CustomEvent dispatched on the window.
- `useClickToRoute(options?)` — click-to-route state machine. Arm / disarm / onParameterClick returning `{ kind: 'created' | 'ignored', reason? }`. Escape-key disarm listener. Board-capability gating via `isParameterModulatableOnBoard`.
- `useBladeEngine()` — now pushes the `parameterGroups.ts` clamp ranges to the engine on init via `setParameterClampRanges()`.

**Starter recipe fixtures** (`packages/presets/src/recipes/modulation/`):

- 5 shipped for v1.0 (bare-source bindings, no expressions): Reactive Shimmer, Sound-Reactive Music Saber, Angle-Reactive Tip, Clash-Flash White (3 bindings), Twist-Drives-Hue. Top-level exports from `@kyberstation/presets` so the web layer imports directly.

**CSS tokens** ([`apps/web/app/globals.css`](apps/web/app/globals.css)):

- 11 `--mod-*` identity colors (one per built-in modulator) as full-color CSS variables, with paired `--mod-*-rgb` triples for alpha compositing. Swing = electric blue, Angle = teal, Twist = violet, Sound = magenta, Battery = green, Time = gold, Clash = near-white, Lockup = amber, Preon = ice-blue, Ignition = cyan, Retraction = warm-red.

**Docs:**

- Design spec: [`docs/MODULATION_ROUTING_V1.1.md`](docs/MODULATION_ROUTING_V1.1.md) (pre-existing; authoritative source for evaluation order, wire format, etc.).
- Implementation plan + 18 locked decisions: [`docs/MODULATION_ROUTING_v1.1_IMPL_PLAN.md`](docs/MODULATION_ROUTING_v1.1_IMPL_PLAN.md).
- Public roadmap (v1.0 → v2.0+): [`docs/MODULATION_ROUTING_ROADMAP.md`](docs/MODULATION_ROUTING_ROADMAP.md).
- User guide outline: [`docs/MODULATION_USER_GUIDE_OUTLINE.md`](docs/MODULATION_USER_GUIDE_OUTLINE.md) — 8 sections + 10 recipes + in-app supplements.
- 60-second quick-start (shipped): [`docs/user-guide/modulation/your-first-wire.md`](docs/user-guide/modulation/your-first-wire.md). Three GIF placeholders marked for Ken to record pre-launch.
- Glyph v2 session handoff: [`docs/NEXT_GLYPH_V2_SESSION.md`](docs/NEXT_GLYPH_V2_SESSION.md) — self-contained prompt for the parallel Kyber Glyph v2 encoder work.

### Changed

- `apps/web/components/editor/DesignPanel.tsx` — added the 4th pill group (`Routing`) with a BETA chip. The pill is hidden entirely when the current board doesn't support modulation (filtered via `canBoardModulate(boardId)`); state-rescue logic uses `useEffect` rather than setState-in-render.
- `apps/web/components/editor/layerstack/LayerStack.tsx` — no changes on main but the modulation work consumes the existing ModulatorRow viz kind convention (the SmoothSwing plate prototype from 2026-04-20).
- `packages/engine/package.json` — added `peggy@^4.2.0` runtime dependency (~25KB gzipped).
- `apps/web/lib/boardProfiles.ts` — cleanup pass by Agent P5 replaced 28 lines of inline-mirrored `BuiltInModulatorId` / `BuiltInFnId` unions with direct imports from `@kyberstation/engine` now that the top-level engine barrel re-exports the modulation subsystem. 21 drift-sentinel `.toContain` string checks in the tests replaced with compile-time assignment assertions.
- `packages/presets/src/index.ts` — top-level barrel now re-exports `MODULATION_RECIPES` + friends.

### Fixed

- **Infinite render loop in ROUTING panel.** `useBladeStore((s) => s.config.modulation?.bindings ?? [])` returned a new empty-array reference every render, triggering Zustand's store-rerender loop. Fixed with a module-level `EMPTY_BINDINGS: readonly SerializedBinding[] = []` constant as the fallback.
- **`setState` called during render** in DesignPanel's board-gating rescue. Moved the `setActiveGroup('appearance')` call into a `useEffect` hook.
- **Card-preview dev page `config.name` coercion** — `string | undefined` → `string` via `?? 'Untitled'` fallback (surfaced during modulation CI run; pre-existing issue from the parallel Kyber Glyph v2 session's dev page).

### Tests (+386)

## [0.11.2] — 2026-04-17

### Changed

- **Color naming system rewritten** as three-tier algorithmic model in
  new `apps/web/lib/namingMath.ts`. Replaces the 121-entry flat
  lookup in `saberColorNames.ts` with:
  - **Tier 1 — Landmarks** (~147 curated Star Wars character/location
    names) at exact HSL points. Every landmark from the original
    dataset preserved verbatim
  - **Tier 2 — Modifier grammar** (10 modifiers: `Pale`, `Deep`,
    `Vivid`, `Muted`, `Dawn-`, `Dusk-`, `Shadowed`, `Bleached`,
    `Ember-`, `Frost-`) applied to nearby-landmark colors. 147 × 10 =
    1,470+ modifier-expanded names algorithmically
  - **Tier 3 — Coordinate-mood fallback** for colors outside any
    landmark's orbit. Pattern: `{ColourMood} Sector {hex}-{hex}` —
    e.g., `Crimson Sector 4E-92`, `Azurine Outer Rim 6D-F7`
- `saberColorNames.ts` becomes a thin shim that re-exports
  `getSaberColorName` from `namingMath.ts`. No call sites need to
  change; every caller stays working.

### Fixed

- Every possible RGB now returns a distinctive, evocative name. Zero
  "Unknown Crystal" fallbacks across the full HSL space.
- Minute color adjustments no longer produce repeated names — modifier
  layers discriminate between neighboring hues.

### Notes

- All existing tests still pass (backward-compatible signature)
- New test suite (`namingMath.test.ts`) covers landmark preservation,
  modifier-trigger boundaries, coordinate-mood stability, and
  1000-sample coverage

---

## [0.11.3] — 2026-04-17

### Added

- **Modular hilt library** (`apps/web/lib/hilts/`) — a composable
  parts + assemblies architecture. Every hilt is an ordered stack of
  discrete parts (emitter, shroud, switch, grip, pommel, accent-ring)
  that mate via three interface-diameter classes (narrow 1.0",
  standard 1.25", wide 1.5"). 33 original MIT-licensed line-art SVG
  parts ship across 5 type directories.
- **8 canonical assemblies** curated from the parts: `graflex`,
  `mpp`, `negotiator`, `count`, `shoto-sage`, `ren-vent` (5-part
  crossguard including the quillon), `zabrak-staff` (double-emitter
  saberstaff), and `fulcrum-pair` (dual-shoto compact).
- **`HiltRenderer`** (`apps/web/components/hilt/HiltRenderer.tsx`) —
  pure React inline SVG renderer with opaque metal-gradient body +
  line-art detail strokes. Supports `vertical` (emitter up) and
  `horizontal` (emitter right) orientations via internal viewBox
  rotation.
- **Editor integration** — 8 new `✦`-tagged options in the Hilt
  picker route through the SVG renderer overlay, coexisting with
  the 9 existing canvas-primitive hilts as a zero-risk addition.
- **Authoring docs** — `docs/HILT_PART_SPEC.md` (canvas, connectors,
  palette, file structure) and `docs/HILT_STAGE_2_BRIEFING.md` (the
  3-agent parallel fan-out plan) define the contribution path for
  community-PR'd parts.

### Tested

- 18 tests across `hiltComposer.test.ts` and `hiltCatalog.test.ts`
  — composition stacking, connector strict + permissive modes,
  emitter tracking, catalog conformance (canvas width 48, connector
  cx=24), per-part spec validation, and round-trip composition of
  every shipped assembly.

### Legal

- All shipped SVG parts are original hand-drawn line art, MIT
  under the same licence as the rest of the project. Reference
  commercial packs used only on-device during authoring — never
  redistributed.

---

## [0.11.1] — 2026-04-17

### Added

- `ErrorState` shared component (`apps/web/components/shared/ErrorState.tsx`)
  with 4 variants (`load-failed`, `parse-failed`, `save-failed`,
  `import-failed`) + optional retry callback + compact-mode rendering
- `StatusSignal` shared component (`apps/web/components/shared/StatusSignal.tsx`)
  pairing status colors with typographic glyphs (●/◉/✓/▲/⚠/✕) for
  colorblind accessibility, with era and faction monogram variants
- CHANGELOG.md documenting the full release history
- `docs/images/landing-hero.png` — live-engine landing screenshot
  referenced from `README.md` above the feature list
- `--faction-sith-deep` and `--faction-jedi-deep` tokens for
  gradient-stop use in `.sw-sith-text` / `.sw-jedi-text`

### Changed

- **Alert-color discipline** — replaced raw `#ff4444` and
  `rgba(255, 60, 60, ...)` in `apps/web/app/globals.css` with theme
  tokens:
  - `.era-sequel` and all era classes now use `rgb(var(--era-*))`
    tokens
  - `@keyframes retract-breathe` now uses `rgb(var(--badge-creative))`
    amber — the retract button is a warning, not an error
  - `.console-alert` now uses `rgb(var(--status-error))` — still red
    (it IS an alert), but tokenised so colorblind theme overrides flow
    through
- Status indicators across `StatusBar.tsx`, `PresetGallery.tsx`,
  `PowerDashboard.tsx`, and `EngineStats.tsx` now pair color with
  `StatusSignal` glyphs (FPS performance bucket, system-status
  indicator, power draw)
- Async-boundary panels across the editor now show `<Skeleton>`
  during loading and `<ErrorState>` on failure (previously: blank
  panels or silent failures)
- `.sw-sith-text` / `.sw-jedi-text` gradient stops routed through
  `rgb(var(--faction-*))` tokens instead of raw hex
- Raw `#22c55e` / `#eab308` / `#ef4444` in `PowerDashboard.tsx` and
  `EngineStats.tsx` replaced with `rgb(var(--status-ok/warn/error))`
  so colorblind + theme overrides flow through

### Fixed

- Era badges in PresetGallery now honour theme overrides (e.g.,
  colorblind palette) instead of rendering raw hex
- Retract-button pulse no longer conflates "action in progress" with
  "error state"

### Infrastructure

- Deleted empty orphan directories: `packages/codegen/src/sharing/`,
  `apps/web/components/sharing/`
- Verified `**/.DS_Store` in root `.gitignore` (already present; no
  tracked files found)

### Notes

- Third-party R/G/B-channel visualization renders in `BladeCanvas.tsx`,
  `VisualizationStack.tsx`, `RGBGraphPanel.tsx`, and
  `visualizationTypes.ts` intentionally keep raw red/green/blue hex
  colors — those represent the literal RGB channels being visualized,
  not alert semantics
- `TimelinePanel.tsx` event-type category colors (ignite/retract/
  clash/blast/etc.) stay as raw hex — these are distinct identity
  colors paired with text labels, not alert semantics. Tokenising
  these would be identity coupling, not accessibility
- **Lint enforcement** (originally scoped for this sprint as Phase C4)
  is deferred. ESLint is not currently in `devDependencies`; activating
  it would surface hundreds of preexisting issues and is worth its own
  sprint with a clear scope for how to handle them (fix vs
  `// eslint-disable-next-line`). Tracked as a follow-up

## Release tagging convention

- Tags use `vX.Y.Z` format (e.g., `v0.10.0`, `v0.11.0`)
- Each release has a corresponding `feat/vX.Y.Z-*` feature branch that
  squash-merges to main
- GitHub releases include a release notes summary and any relevant
  build artefacts (firmware binaries for v0.11.x, for example)
